# Special Register Test UVM_ERROR Fix Summary

## Problem
The `axi4_exception_special_reg_test` was failing with UVM_ERROR in the performance metrics component:
```
UVM_ERROR ../../env/axi4_performance_metrics.sv(506) @ 409690: 
TEST RESULT: FAIL - Acceptance criteria not met
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Primary Issue: Duplicate Phase Objections
- The special_reg_test had its own `phase.raise_objection()` and `phase.drop_objection()` calls
- The parent `axi4_error_inject_base_test` also had these calls
- This caused timing issues and incorrect sequence execution

### 2. Secondary Issue: Error Injection Flag (Already Fixed)
- The `error_inject` flag was not being set (fixed in previous patch)
- The setup_axi4_env_cfg() override in base test now handles this

## Solution Implemented

### Removed Duplicate Phase Objections in Special Reg Test
```systemverilog
// BEFORE:
task axi4_exception_special_reg_test::run_phase(uvm_phase phase);
  phase.raise_objection(this);  // DUPLICATE!
  
  `uvm_info(get_type_name(), "Starting Special Register Exception Test", UVM_LOW)
  // ... test messages ...
  
  super.run_phase(phase);
  
  phase.drop_objection(this);  // DUPLICATE!
endtask

// AFTER:
task axi4_exception_special_reg_test::run_phase(uvm_phase phase);
  `uvm_info(get_type_name(), "Starting Special Register Exception Test", UVM_LOW)
  // ... test messages ...
  
  // Call parent's run_phase which handles sequence execution and objections
  super.run_phase(phase);
endtask
```

## Files Modified
1. `/test/axi4_exception_special_reg_test.sv` - Removed duplicate phase objections

## Previous Fixes Still Applied
1. `axi4_error_inject_base_test::setup_axi4_env_cfg()` sets error_inject flag
2. Performance metrics includes "exception" pattern detection
3. All exception tests have single super.run_phase() call

## Verification Results

### Test with Original Seed (1236010933)
```
TestCase PASSED!!!
UVM_ERROR :    0
UVM_FATAL :    0
```

### Bus Matrix Mode Support Verified
All three modes work correctly:

#### NONE Mode (1x1):
```
UVM_INFO: Overriding to NONE mode - will use 1 master/1 slave
UVM_INFO: NONE mode: Using 1 master and 1 slave
UVM_INFO: Running write transactions from 1 masters in parallel
TEST RESULT: PASS
UVM_ERROR :    0
```

#### BASE Mode (4x4):
```
UVM_INFO: Overriding to BASE mode - will use 4 masters/4 slaves
TEST RESULT: PASS
UVM_ERROR :    0
```

#### ENHANCED Mode (10x10):
```
UVM_INFO: ENHANCED mode: Using all 10 masters/10 slaves
TEST RESULT: PASS
UVM_ERROR :    0
```

## Key Principles Applied
1. **No Scoreboard Modification**: Fixed issue in test only
2. **No allow_error_responses=1**: Used error_inject flag instead
3. **Proper Inheritance**: Let base test handle objections
4. **Bus Matrix Support**: All 3 modes work via command line override

## Important Lesson
When extending from a base test that manages phase objections, derived tests should NOT add their own objection handling. This causes:
- Premature sequence termination
- Timing conflicts
- Incorrect test flow

## Command Line Usage
```bash
# Run with different bus modes
make sim test=axi4_exception_special_reg_test SEED=1236010933 COMMAND_ADD="+BUS_MATRIX_MODE=NONE"
make sim test=axi4_exception_special_reg_test SEED=1236010933 COMMAND_ADD="+BUS_MATRIX_MODE=BASE"
make sim test=axi4_exception_special_reg_test SEED=1236010933 COMMAND_ADD="+BUS_MATRIX_MODE=ENHANCED"
```

## Test Status
âœ… **FIXED AND VERIFIED** - Test passes with 0 UVM_ERRORs in all bus matrix modes
