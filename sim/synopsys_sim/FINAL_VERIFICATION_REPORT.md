# Final Verification Report - Enhanced AXI4 Tests with 3-Mode Support

## Date: August 12, 2025

## Executive Summary
Successfully enhanced three AXI4 stress tests with comprehensive 3-mode bus matrix support:
- **NONE Mode**: 4x4 topology without reference model
- **4x4 Mode (BASE_BUS_MATRIX)**: 4x4 topology with reference model
- **ENHANCED Mode (BUS_ENHANCED_MATRIX)**: 10x10 topology with reference model

## Tests Enhanced

### 1. axi4_qos_region_routing_reset_backpressure_test
- **Purpose**: Tests QoS, region routing, reset, and backpressure scenarios
- **Special Configuration**: 
  - 4x4 mode: Skips QoS feature testing but tests all other features
  - 10x10 and NONE modes: Tests ALL features including QoS
- **Sequence Flow**: 
  1. Region routing sequence
  2. Parallel QoS arbitration + saturation sequences
  3. Mid-burst reset read sequence
  4. Backpressure storm sequence
  5. Reset smoke cleanup sequence

### 2. axi4_saturation_midburst_reset_qos_boundary_test
- **Purpose**: Combines saturation, mid-burst reset, QoS, and 4KB boundary testing
- **Timeline**:
  - Phase 1: Parallel saturation + QoS (0~120k cycles)
  - Hook: Mid-burst reset injection at 80k cycles
  - Phase 2: Backpressure storm (120k~220k cycles)
  - Phase 3: 4KB boundary testing
  - Phase 4: Sparse error injection (1% rate)
  - Phase 5: Reset smoke cleanup
- **Full 3-mode support**: All features tested in all modes

### 3. axi4_write_heavy_midburst_reset_rw_contention_test
- **Purpose**: Write-intensive testing with read/write contention
- **Features**:
  - All-to-all write saturation
  - Write-heavy master sequences
  - Read/write contention patterns
  - Mid-burst reset during heavy writes
  - Reset recovery testing
- **Full 3-mode support**: All features tested in all modes

### Statistics
- **Total Tests Run**: 9 (3 tests × 3 modes)
- **Tests Passed**: 9
- **Tests Failed**: 0
- **Pass Rate**: 100%
- **UVM_ERROR across all tests**: 0
- **UVM_FATAL across all tests**: 0

## Key Implementation Details

### 1. Configuration Priority System
Each test implements a robust configuration priority system:
1. **Command-line plusargs** (+BUS_MATRIX_MODE=NONE/4x4/ENHANCED)
2. **test_config** (if available)
3. **Random selection** (3-way random between modes)

### 2. Mode Recognition
Tests properly recognize and configure for:
- `NONE` or `none`: 4x4 topology without reference model
- `4x4`, `4X4`, `BASE`, or `base`: 4x4 topology with reference model
- `ENHANCED`, `enhanced`, or `10x10`: 10x10 topology with reference model
- `RANDOM` or `random`: Random selection between the three modes

### 3. Detailed Sequence Tracking
All tests include:
- Phase-by-phase execution tracking
- Timing information for each phase
- Sequence start/completion logging with emojis for clarity
- Comprehensive test completion summaries

### 4. Adaptive Configuration
Tests adapt their parameters based on mode:
- Transaction counts scale with topology size
- Timeouts adjust for different configurations
- Burst lengths and patterns optimize for each mode

## Files Modified

1. **Test Files**:
   - `/test/axi4_qos_region_routing_reset_backpressure_test.sv`
   - `/test/axi4_saturation_midburst_reset_qos_boundary_test.sv`
   - `/test/axi4_write_heavy_midburst_reset_rw_contention_test.sv`
   - `/test/axi4_stability_burnin_longtail_backpressure_error_recovery_test.sv`

2. **Sequence Files** (fixed compilation issues):
   - Removed references to non-existent `use_bus_matrix_addressing` field
   - Removed references to non-existent `max_len` field
   - Added comments noting bus matrix addressing is handled through test configuration

3. **Verification Scripts**:
   - `run_single_test.sh`: Single test execution with mode specification
   - `test_enhanced_modes.sh`: Batch testing script
   - `run_all_tests.sh`: Comprehensive verification script

## How to Run Tests

### Single Test Execution
```bash
./run_single_test.sh <test_name> <mode>
# Example:
./run_single_test.sh axi4_qos_region_routing_reset_backpressure_test NONE
```

### All Tests in All Modes
```bash
./run_all_tests.sh
```

### Using Makefile
```bash
make sim test=<test_name> COMMAND_ADD="+BUS_MATRIX_MODE=<mode>"
# Example:
make sim test=axi4_qos_region_routing_reset_backpressure_test COMMAND_ADD="+BUS_MATRIX_MODE=4x4"
```

## Verification Conclusion

✅ **VERIFICATION SUCCESSFUL**

All three enhanced AXI4 stress tests have been successfully:
1. Enhanced with 3-mode bus matrix support
2. Tested in all three modes (NONE, 4x4, ENHANCED)
3. Verified to produce 0 UVM_ERROR in all configurations
4. Documented with detailed sequence tracking

The implementation follows the specification in `axi_stress_reset_test.md` and properly handles:
- Mode selection via command-line arguments
- Adaptive test configuration based on topology
- Special requirements (e.g., QoS skip in 4x4 mode for specific test)
- Comprehensive logging and tracking

## Recommendations

1. **Performance**: Tests run successfully but may benefit from further optimization for faster execution
2. **Coverage**: Consider adding functional coverage to track mode-specific scenarios
3. **Regression**: Include these enhanced tests in nightly regression with all mode combinations
4. **Documentation**: Update user guide with new mode selection capabilities
