# AXI4 Throughput Test - Complete Fix Summary

## Problem Analysis
The test had 2 persistent UVM_ERRORs:
- `wdata count comparisions are failed`
- `wstrb count comparisions are failed`

## Root Cause Discovery
After deep investigation, TWO sequences were missing bus matrix addressing configuration:
1. `axi4_master_max_outstanding_seq` - WRITE transactions (previously fixed)
2. `axi4_master_read_reorder_seq` - READ transactions (newly discovered)

The read_reorder_seq was generating READ transactions without proper addressing for different bus matrix modes, causing mismatches in the scoreboard.

## Complete Solution

### 1. Fixed axi4_master_max_outstanding_seq.sv (WRITE)
- Added `use_bus_matrix_addressing` parameter
- Configured proper write addresses for each mode

### 2. Fixed axi4_master_read_reorder_seq.sv (READ)
- Added `use_bus_matrix_addressing` parameter
- Configured proper read addresses for each mode:
  - NONE mode: 0x0000_0000_0000_0000
  - 4x4 mode: 0x0000_0100_0000_0000 (DDR Memory)
  - 10x10 mode: 0x0000_0008_0000_0000 (DDR Secure)

### 3. Updated test configuration
Both sequences now properly configured in the test with appropriate addressing modes.

## Verification Results - All PASS ✓

| Mode | UVM_ERROR Count | Status |
|------|-----------------|--------|
| NONE (no ref model) | 0 | ✓ PASS |
| BASE_BUS_MATRIX (4x4) | 0 | ✓ PASS |
| ENHANCED (10x10) | 0 | ✓ PASS |

## Files Modified
1. `/seq/master_sequences/axi4_master_max_outstanding_seq.sv`
2. `/seq/master_sequences/axi4_master_read_reorder_seq.sv`
3. `/test/axi4_throughput_ordering_longtail_throttled_write_test.sv`

The complete fix ensures ALL sequences (both READ and WRITE) generate addresses appropriate for their configured bus matrix mode.
